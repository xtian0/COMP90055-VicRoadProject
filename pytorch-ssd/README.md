# COMP90055-VicRoadProject
This is a research project about vehicle detection and classification.
The project uses YOLOv3 and SSD models for identifying and classifying the vehicles, and Deep SORT algorithm for tracking and counting the occurrences of vehicles of each class.

## How to Use
* Dataset:
    * Preparing the images for your dataset by using the video capturing tool `COMP90055-VicRoadProject/snapshot/` 
    * Data augmentation `COMP90055-VicRoadProject/image-augmentor`
    * Labeling the images `COMP90055-VicRoadProject/labelImg`
* Model:
    * YOLOv3: `COMP90055-VicRoadProject/keras-yolo3`
    * SSD: `COMP90055-VicRoadProject/pytorch-ssd`
* For more details, please refer to README.md in each folder.
